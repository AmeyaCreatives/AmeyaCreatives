## Introduction
Welcome to the AmeyaCretives GitHub standards guide. These standards are designed to ensure that our GitHub repository is well-organized, secure, and conducive to efficient collaboration among team members.

## Repository Management
- Create a clear and descriptive repository name.
- Maintain an informative README with project details, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- Use GitHub projects or milestones to track project progress and manage tasks.

## Branching Strategy
- Adopt a branching strategy such as Gitflow for organized development.
- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure that the `main` or `master` branch is kept stable.

## Commit Messages
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Start the message with a short, descriptive summary.
- Include additional information and context in the message body if necessary.

## Pull Requests
- Create a pull request (PR) for each code change or new feature.
- Include detailed information in the PR description, explaining what the changes address.
- Assign at least one reviewer for each PR to ensure code quality.

## Issue Tracking
- Use GitHub issues for tracking and managing tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
- Label issues appropriately to categorize and prioritize them.
- Reference issues in commit messages and PRs for cross-linking.

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Respect code review feedback and address issues or comments promptly.
- Keep discussions and comments constructive and professional.
- Maintain a regular and consistent workflow for code submissions.

## Security Considerations
- Protect sensitive data, such as access tokens or passwords, from being exposed in the repository.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

These GitHub standards are crucial for efficient collaboration and version control in our "presidencyDays" project. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our repository remains organized, secure, and well-documented, facilitating seamless teamwork and development.

If you have questions about these standards or need clarifications, please reach out to the project lead.
