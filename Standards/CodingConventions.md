## Introduction
Welcome to the AmeyaCreatives coding standards guide. These standards are designed to promote consistency, readability, and maintainability in our game development project. Following these guidelines will help ensure that our codebase is efficient, bug-free, and scalable.

## File and Folder Structure
- Maintain a clear and organized project folder structure.
- Use meaningful file and folder names.
- Group related assets and scripts in subdirectories.

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and assets.
- Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., CamelCase for classes, PascalCase for functions, lowercase for variables).
- Avoid single-letter variable names unless used in short, clear contexts.

## Code Organization
- Organize code logically, keeping related functions and variables together.
- Use meaningful comments and whitespace to break up code sections.
- Keep lines of code reasonably short (around 80 characters) to enhance readability.

## Commenting
- Add clear and concise comments for complex or non-obvious code sections.
- Use comments to describe the purpose of functions, classes, and variables.
- Include TODO comments to highlight future work or improvements.

## Variables
- Declare variables with meaningful names that reflect their purpose.
- Avoid using global variables whenever possible.
- Minimize variable scope; declare them within the smallest necessary scope.

## Functions and Methods
- Keep functions and methods concise and focused on a single task.
- Use meaningful function and method names that indicate their purpose.
- Limit the number of parameters for functions (aim for 3 or fewer).

## Conditional Statements
- Format conditional statements for clarity.
- Use parentheses to make the order of operations explicit.
- Favor switch statements for multiple, related conditions.

## Loops
- Use for, foreach, or while loops when appropriate.
- Ensure that loop exit conditions are clear and safe to prevent infinite loops.

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling, including try-catch blocks when needed.
- Provide informative error messages to aid debugging.

## Unity-Specific Guidelines
- Adhere to Unity's C# coding conventions.
- Follow Unity's asset naming and organization standards.
- Utilize the Unity Inspector for public variables when applicable.

## Unreal Engine-Specific Guidelines
- Follow Epic Games' coding standards for C++.
- Maintain consistent Blueprint scripting practices.
- Adhere to Unreal Engine's asset naming and organization conventions.

These coding standards are essential for maintaining code quality and collaboration in our game development project. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our project remains efficient, readable, and free of unnecessary errors. Please consult this document whenever you have questions about coding practices.

For any project-specific deviations or clarifications, feel free to reach out to the project lead or coding standards committee.
